# Insp3ct0r

There is some interesting information hidden around this site (link). Can you find it?


# Hints
1. You should have enough hints to find the files, don't run a brute forcer.

# What I Did

I checked all the button in the website. Since i don't see any
API request to other link, i inspect the source of the page

then i found the first part of the flag in the HTML file

```bash picoCTF{t```

the second part of the flag is in the CSS file

```bash h4ts_4_l0 ```

and then in the javascript file i found the clue for the
third part of the flag

```bash How can I keep Google from indexing my website? ```

then I search in google "google indexing website" and I found the 
documentation of how google indexing a website in this link

https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7645831?hl=en

then I tried to open the (link)/robots.txt, I found another clue
to the next part of the flag 

```bash I think this is an apache server... can you Access the next flag? ```

and found the 
third part of the flag which is
```bash t_0f_pl4c```

The fourth part of the flag is related to apache server
thing, so I look at apache documentation and one of the
section is explaining about directory things in apache
in this link

https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/howto/htaccess.html

then i tried to open the (link)/.access, I got the fifth part of
the flag clue which is 

```bash I love making websites on my Mac, I can Store a lot of information there.```

and I got the
fourth part of the flag

```bash 3s_2_lO0k```

for the fifth flag, I failed to find the documentation
of the mac os that explaining about website development
but I found it on the CTF write ups(https://ctftime.org/writeup/26981).
It tells me that i need to use (link)/.DS_Store

and I got the 
fifth part of the flag

```bash _fa04427c}```


and the flag is 

```bash picoCTF{th4ts_4_l0t_0f_pl4c3s_2_lO0k_fa04427c}```
