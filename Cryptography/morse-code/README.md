# What I Did
Based on the file and the title of this challenge, its giving us morse code
in audio. For those who don't know morse code
it's basically a code that use dot and line
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code


Rather than decoding it manually i used this
online decoder for morse code
https://morsecode.world/international/decoder/audio-decoder-adaptive.html
to get the flag.


The flag is
``` 

picoCTF{WH47_H47H_90D_W20U9H7}
